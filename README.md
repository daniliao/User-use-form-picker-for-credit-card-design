Initialize a Git repository in your Xcode project:

```
cd /path/to/your/Xcode/project
git init
```
Add your GitHub repository as a remote:

```
git remote add origin <repository_url>
```
Commit your changes:
In Xcode, make any changes you want to upload to GitHub. Then, in Terminal, navigate to your Xcode project directory and run the following command to stage and commit your changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```
Push your changes to GitHub:
Finally, push your committed changes to your GitHub repository by running the following command:
